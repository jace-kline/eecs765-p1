# EECS 765 Project 1

## Introduction

A brief overview of the programming assignment (1-2 paragraphs)

## Running the Exploit

Specify whether the exploit works or not: works with the IP addresses indicated in the PA1 description? works with other IP addresses?
How can someone else run your exploit? Specify the exact commands and the reverse shell port
Show the reader that it worked for you (print screens may be very helpful)

## Developing the Exploit

### Malicious Input Structure

Describe the structure of the input, explain why you chose this structure and what you are hoping to achieve.

### Malicious Input Parameters

What are the paramaters you need to determine and why? e.g., little or big endian architecture, buffer length, distance to saved_EIP, value stored in saved_EIP, etc.
How did you determine the values for the above-mentioned paramaters?

### Generating the Malicious Input

What programming language did you use?
How did you construct the malicious input? (brief description)

## References and Collaborations

Specify your online or hardcopy sources of information (especially if your exploit is based on someone else's source code - should NOT be a classmate)
List the people that you discussed the programming assignment with. Also, add a very brief description of what you discussed with each individual. Don't forget that programming assignments are individual assignments
